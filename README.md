# PHP Clean Architecture Studies
Studying Clean Architecture with PHP following a course on [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/).

What I learned so far:

* Entities;

* Builder Creational Design Pattern;
* Named Constructors;
* Creating repositories;
* Making Domains agnostic to the infrastructure;
* Making infrastructure services separated form the domain services;
* Defining application layer;
* Services:
    * Domain Services represent actions between entities;
    * Application Services control our business flow and functions as entry points for the application;
    * Infrastructure Services implement interfaces from the domain and application layers.




Challenges:

* Sendidng recommendation mails;
* Moving recommendation interface to domain;
